## Direct Answer: Are Smart Locks Secure?

**Modern smart locks (2020+) are MORE secure than traditional locks when properly configured.**

**Quick verdict:**
- ✅ Modern smart locks resist physical attacks better than many traditional locks
- ✅ Encryption prevents wireless eavesdropping/replay attacks
- ✅ Audit logs provide accountability (traditional locks = zero visibility)
- ⚠️ Security depends heavily on correct installation and configuration
- ❌ Poorly implemented smart locks can be less secure than quality traditional locks

**Key insight:** The question isn't "smart vs traditional" but "**which smart lock with what configuration**."

## Threat Model: Understanding Attack Vectors {#threat-model}

### Attack Surface Analysis

Smart locks introduce **multiple attack vectors** compared to traditional locks:

```
Traditional Lock: 1 attack vector
└─ Physical attack (pick, bump, drill)

Smart Lock: 5 attack vectors
├─ Physical attack (lock mechanism)
├─ Wireless attack (RF interception)
├─ Network attack (hub/cloud)
├─ Application attack (mobile app)
└─ Supply chain (firmware backdoors)
```

**Critical understanding:** More attack vectors ≠ less secure. **Each vector has different difficulty and likelihood.**

### Real-World Attack Likelihood

Based on 200+ reported vulnerabilities (2015-2024):

| Attack Vector | Likelihood | Skill Required | Cost | Detection Risk |
|--------------|------------|----------------|------|----------------|
| **Physical picking** | High | Low | $20 | Low |
| **Wireless replay** | Low | Medium | $150 | Medium |
| **Network intrusion** | Very Low | High | Varies | High |
| **App exploitation** | Very Low | High | $0 | High |
| **Supply chain** | Extremely Low | Very High | N/A | Certain |

**Reality check:** 95% of smart lock "hacks" require physical access to lock + specialized tools. Remote attacks are exceedingly rare for consumer locks.

### Attack Difficulty Comparison

**Easier than traditional locks:**
- ❌ Default PIN codes (if not changed)
- ❌ Unencrypted older models (pre-2017)
- ❌ Exposed debug ports (JTAG/SWD)

**Similar to traditional locks:**
- ≈ Physical lock picking (smart locks use same mechanisms)
- ≈ Destructive entry (drilling, prying)

**Harder than traditional locks:**
- ✅ Modern encrypted wireless (AES-128 with rolling codes)
- ✅ Cloud authentication (multi-factor possible)
- ✅ Audit logging (detectable attempts)

## Protocol Security Comparison

### Encryption Standards

| Protocol | Encryption | Key Management | Replay Protection | Certification |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **WiFi** | TLS 1.2+ | Cloud-managed | Timestamp/nonce | Varies |
| **Zigbee 3.0** | AES-128 CCM | Network key + link keys | Sequence numbers | Required |
| **Z-Wave S2** | AES-128 | 3-tier model | Rolling codes | Mandatory |
| **Thread/Matter** | AES-128 CCM | Certificate-based | IPv6 security | Required |

### Z-Wave S2: Gold Standard {#zwave-s2}

**Why Z-Wave S2 is considered most secure:**

**Three-tier security model:**

1. **S2 Unauthenticated** (lowest)
   - Basic AES-128 encryption
   - No device verification
   - **NOT allowed for locks**

2. **S2 Authenticated** (medium)
   - AES-128 + DSK verification
   - Protected from MITM attacks
   - **Permitted but not recommended for locks**

3. **S2 Access Control** (highest)
   - **REQUIRED for all Z-Wave locks**
   - Mandatory DSK authentication
   - Encrypted commands
   - Tamper detection
   - Secure firmware updates
   - Audit logging

**DSK (Device Specific Key) Authentication:**

```
Pairing Process:
1. Start inclusion on hub
2. Activate lock pairing mode
3. Hub requests lock's DSK
4. USER verifies first 5 digits of DSK
   (printed on lock or manual)
5. Secure pairing completes
```

**This prevents:** Attacker from injecting rogue device during pairing window.

**Real-world impact:** All Z-Wave locks since 2017 support S2 Access Control. Older S0 locks should be upgraded.

### Zigbee 3.0 Security

**Key features:**
- AES-128 encryption (same as Z-Wave)
- Install codes for secure pairing
- Network key + individual link keys

**Difference from Z-Wave:**
- Network key is shared (all devices)
- Z-Wave S2 uses unique keys per device
- **Compromise risk:** Zigbee network key compromise = all devices at risk

**Mitigation:** Change network key periodically, use install codes

### WiFi Security Layers

**Multi-layered protection:**

1. **WiFi layer:** WPA2/WPA3
2. **Transport layer:** TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS/MQTT)
3. **Application layer:** AES-128/256 for commands
4. **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 / JWT tokens

**Vulnerability points:**
- ☁️ Cloud server breach (manufacturer responsibility)
- 📱 Phone app compromise
- 🏠 Home network intrusion

**Best practice:** Choose reputable manufacturers with strong security track record.

### Thread/Matter Security

**Modern security approach:**
- Certificate-based authentication
- Commissioning via QR code + PIN
- AES-128 encryption
- IPv6 with IPsec support

**Advantage:** Standardized security across manufacturers (Matter certification required)

## Security Best Practices

### Installation Security

**Physical installation matters as much as digital security:**

1. **Deadbolt requirement**
   - Smart locks with latches alone are insufficient
   - Deadbolt provides backup security
   - Prevents card bypass attacks

2. **Strike plate reinforcement**
   - 3-inch screws into door frame
   - Metal strike plate
   - Prevents kick-in attacks

3. **Door frame inspection**
   - No gaps >1/8 inch
   - Solid frame (not hollow)
   - Properly aligned hinges

4. **Backup access methods**
   - Physical key backup (hide off-premises)
   - PIN keypad
   - Multiple admin access (family members)

### Configuration Security

**Critical settings to configure immediately:**

✅ **Change default PINs**
- Factory PIN → Strong random PIN
- Document securely (password manager)

✅ **Enable auto-lock**
- 30-60 second delay
- Prevents "forgot to lock" scenarios

✅ **Enable tamper alerts**
- Notifications for wrong PIN attempts
- Physical tampering detection
- Low battery warnings

✅ **Limit user access**
- Temporary codes for guests
- Scheduled access (9am-5pm for service)
- Individual codes (accountability)

✅ **Enable audit logging**
- Review weekly
- Look for suspicious patterns
- Keep logs for security incidents

### Network Security

**Secure your smart home network:**

1. **Separate network for IoT**
   - Guest network or VLAN
   - Isolate from main network
   - Prevent lateral movement

2. **Strong WiFi password**
   - WPA3 if available (WPA2 minimum)
   - Random 20+ character password
   - Change if compromised

3. **Router firmware updates**
   - Enable automatic updates
   - Check quarterly manually
   - Replace old routers (5+ years)

4. **Firewall configuration**
   - Block unnecessary ports
   - Enable UPnP only if needed
   - Monitor connected devices

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can smart locks be hacked remotely?

**Short answer:** Extremely difficult for modern (2020+) locks with proper configuration.

**Long answer:**
- Modern locks use AES-128 encryption
- Remote hacks require cloud vulnerability
- No documented cases of remote unlock of properly configured modern locks
- Physical access + specialized tools much more common attack vector

**Bottom line:** You're more likely to be physically picked than remotely hacked.

### Do I need a security system with my smart lock?

**Depends on risk level:**

**Low risk:** Smart lock alone sufficient  
**Medium risk:** Add door/window sensors  
**High risk:** Full security system recommended

**Synergy:** Smart lock + alarm system = comprehensive protection

### What happens if manufacturer shuts down?

**Varies by lock type:**

**WiFi locks:**
- Cloud dependency = major risk
- May lose remote access
- Local backup (keypad) still works

**Mesh locks (Zigbee/Z-Wave/Matter):**
- Local processing = continues working
- May lose firmware updates
- Basic functionality preserved

**Mitigation:** Choose established brands with long track record

### Are smart locks approved by insurance?

**Generally yes, with caveats:**
- Must meet local building codes
- Deadbolt requirement (most insurers)
- No discount (unlike monitored alarms)
- Check specific policy

**Some insurers offer discounts for:**
- Smart lock + security system
- Professional installation
- Monitored access logging
