## Quick Answer: The 11:59 PM Expiration Rule

**Temporary code creation follows standard user addition procedure with critical temporal precision requirement: configure expiration to 11:59 PM of LAST valid access day rather than 12:00 AM of subsequent day, avoiding timezone edge cases and clock synchronization ambiguities that cause premature expiration creating guest lockouts hours before intended cutoff.** This one-minute configuration difference—11:59 PM versus 12:00 AM—prevents majority of temporary code failures encountered in short-term rental operations where guests arrive to find codes mysteriously "expired" despite being within stated access windows.

The start-time buffer strategy (beginning access 1-2 hours pre-check-in) accommodates travel delays, timezone confusion, and early arrivals without security compromise, while generous end-time extension (full day beyond checkout versus precise checkout hour) eliminates lockout anxiety from late departures or forgotten items requiring re-entry. Conservative timing proves operationally superior to tight windows: guest convenience and access reliability justify modest security window extension versus rigid scheduling creating failure modes.

**Mandatory pre-arrival testing**—personally verifying code functionality 12-24 hours before guest arrival—transforms potential synchronization failures into detected issues resolvable before user impact, rather than discovering problems through panicked guest calls reporting "code not working" moments after arrival at property.

## Why Temporary Codes Matter

### Use Cases

**Vacation rentals (Airbnb, VRBO):**
- Unique code per booking
- Auto-expires after checkout
- No key handoff needed
- Prevents past guests from returning

**Contractors/Service providers:**
- One-time access  - plumber, electrician
- Limited to work hours
- Expires same day
- No ongoing access

**House guests:**
- Family visiting for weekend
- Friends staying while traveling
- Expires automatically
- Don't need to remember to delete

**Emergency access:**
- Pet sitter for vacation
- Neighbor checking house
- Pre-defined end date
- Peace of mind

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Determine Access Window

**Calculate dates:**
```
Example Airbnb booking:
Check-in: Friday, March 15, 3:00 PM
Check-out: Monday, March 18, 11:00 AM

Code access should be:
Start: Friday, March 15, 2:00 PM (1 hour early buffer)
End: Monday, March 18, 11:59 PM (FULL day after checkout)
  OR: Monday, March 18, 12:00 PM (1 hour after checkout)

Why end 11:59 PM not 11:00 AM:
- Gives buffer for late checkout
- Avoids timezone confusion
- Prevents accidental early expiration
```

**Conservative vs Tight:**

**Conservative (recommended for guests):**
```
Start: 2-3 hours before check-in
End: Full day of check-out (11:59 PM)
Pros: ✅ No guest lockouts
      ✅ Handles delays
Cons: ⚠️ Slightly longer access window
```

**Tight (contractors, one-time):**
```
Start: Exactly at appointment time
End: Same day end of business
Pros: ✅ Minimal access window
Cons: ⚠️ If they're early, can't enter
```

### Step 2: Create Temporary Code

```
□ Open smart lock app
□ Select lock (if multiple)
□ Users / Codes / Access
□ Add User / Add Code
□ Select "Temporary" or "Guest"
```

### Step 3: Enter Details

```
Name:
□ Descriptive name
  Examples:
  - "Airbnb - Smith - 3/15-18"
  - "Plumber - Kitchen Sink - 3/15"
  - "Guest - Sarah Weekend - 3/22-24"
  
PIN Code:
□ 4-8 digits (most locks)
□ Auto-generated OR custom
  - Auto: More secure (random)
  - Custom: Easier to remember
□ Don't reuse recent codes

Access Schedule:
□ Type: Temporary
□ Start Date: [Date]
□ Start Time: [Time] ⚠️ See timing tips below
□ End Date: [Date]
□ End Time: [Time] ⚠️ CRITICAL - see below
```

### Step 4: Set Expiration Correctly

**The #1 mistake causing guest lockouts:**

```
WRONG:
End: March 18, 12:00 AM (midnight)
Problem: Lock interprets as START of March 18
Result: Code expires at midnight going INTO March 18
        Guest locked out for full last day!

CORRECT:
End: March 18, 11:59 PM
Result: Code valid entire day March 18
        Expires at end of day

ALSO CORRECT:
End: March 19, 12:00 AM (next day midnight)
Result: Code valid through March 18
        Safer buffer
```

**Best practice:**
- Checkout day 11:00 AM → Set expiration 11:59 PM same day
- Gives 12+ hour buffer for delays
- No guest lockout risk

### Step 5: Save and Sync

```
□ Tap "Save" or "Create"
□ App syncs to lock (2-5 minutes)
  - WiFi: 30 seconds
  - Zigbee/Z-Wave: 1-2 minutes
□ Wait for "Success" or "Synced" message
□ Don't close app during sync
```

### Step 6: Test BEFORE Guest Arrives

**CRITICAL STEP - Never skip:**

```
Day before guest arrives:
□ Go to lock keypad
□ Enter temporary code
□ Verify lock unlocks
□ Check app shows code as "Active"
□ Test at actual start time if possible

If code doesn't work:
□ Check start time hasn't begun yet
□ Wait until start time passes
□ Try again

If still doesn't work:
□ Delete code
□ Re-add with immediate start
□ Test again
□ Contact guest with new code if needed
```

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake 1: Expiration Time Confusion

**Problem:**
```
Set: "Check-out March 20, 12:00 AM"
Think: Midnight END of March 20
Reality: Midnight START of March 20
Result: Code expires 24 hours early
```

**Fix:**
```
✅ Use 11:59 PM of last valid day
✅ OR: 12:00 AM of NEXT day
✅ Add comment in name: "Valid thru 3/20"
```

### Mistake 2: No Buffer Time

**Problem:**
```
Check-in: 3:00 PM
Code start: 3:00 PM
Guest arrives: 2:45 PM (15 min early)
Result: Guest can't enter, calls upset
```

**Fix:**
```
✅ Start code 1-2 hours before check-in
✅ Communicate: "Code active from 2PM"
✅ Buffer accommodates traffic, early arrival
```

### Mistake 3: Timezone Confusion

**Problem:**
```
You're in California (PST)
Guest from New York (EST)
Set code: 3:00 PM PST
Guest tries: 3:00 PM EST (12PM PST)
Result: Code not active yet
```

**Fix:**
```
✅ Specify timezone in communication
✅ Use guest's local time if possible
✅ Add buffer (makes timezone less critical)
✅ Test code yourself before guest's time zone
```

### Mistake 4: Code Still Active After Checkout

**Problem:**
```
Forget to set end date
Code never expires
Past guest returns months later
Enters home unexpectedly
```

**Fix:**
```
✅ ALWAYS set end date
✅ Double-check expiration before saving
✅ Review active codes monthly
✅ Set calendar reminder to verify deletion
```

## Troubleshooting

### Guest Says Code Doesn't Work

**Check:**
```
□ Is current time within access window?
  - Too early? Wait until start time
  - Past end time? Code expired

□ Is lock online?
  - Check app status
  - If offline, code can't be verified

□ Is guest entering correctly?
  - No spaces or dashes
  - Correct order
  - Press # after (if required)

□ Did code sync successfully?
  - Check app for "Synced" status
  - Resend if not synced
```

**Quick fix:**
```
1. Create new code with immediate start
2. Test yourself
3. Send new code to guest
4. Delete old code
```

## Security Considerations

## Summary: Temporal Precision Prevents Access Failures

Temporary code management centers on temporal configuration precision rather than procedural complexity: the mechanics of code creation prove identical to permanent user addition, but start/end time specification demands attention to timezone handling, clock synchronization edge cases, and buffer strategies that differentiate reliable guest access from lockout-prone implementations.

**The 11:59 PM expiration imperative** represents the single most critical configuration detail: setting expiration to 11:59 PM of last valid day rather than 12:00 AM (midnight) of subsequent day avoids timezone conversion ambiguities, daylight saving transitions, and clock synchronization uncertainties that manifest as premature expiration. This seemingly trivial one-minute difference prevents the majority of "code expired early" failures where guests arrive within stated access windows yet find codes mysteriously inactive—the result of midnight boundary conditions evaluated differently by cloud servers versus local lock firmware.

**Conservative buffer strategies** prove operationally superior to tight access windows despite appearing security-compromising: starting codes 1-2 hours pre-check-in accommodates flight delays, traffic, timezone confusion, and early arrivals without requiring panicked host intervention, while extending expiration to end-of-day (11:59 PM) rather than precise checkout time (11:00 AM) eliminates late departure anxiety and forgotten-item re-entry scenarios. The marginal security exposure from extended access windows proves negligible compared to operational friction from rigid timing creating guest frustration and host emergency troubleshooting.

**Pre-arrival testing discipline** transforms theoretical access into verified functionality: personally testing codes 12-24 hours before guest arrival detects synchronization failures, configuration errors, or system outages while resolution time remains available, rather than discovering problems through guest emergency calls moments after property arrival. This proactive verification represents insurance against cloud service outages, network connectivity issues, or application bugs that render codes non-functional despite correct configuration.

**Descriptive naming conventions** enable rapid code identification and cleanup: labels like "Guest-SmithFamily-3/15-18" immediately communicate purpose, occupant, and validity period without consulting external booking records, facilitating monthly audit reviews identifying codes that failed to auto-expire (signaling system bugs requiring manual deletion). Generic labels like "Guest1" or "Temp Code" create administrative overhead requiring cross-referencing to determine code purpose and intended lifespan.

**Post-checkout verification** closes the access lifecycle: confirming codes display "Expired" status in application after guest departure, manually deleting any remaining active, and reviewing access logs for post-checkout entry attempts (signaling code-sharing violations or past guests attempting re-entry). This verification catches auto-expiration failures before security exposure accumulates across multiple bookings.

**The reliability hierarchy**: Conservative start times (early) + generous end times (late) + 11:59 PM expiration + pre-arrival testing + post-checkout verification creates defense-in-depth against individual failure modes. Inverting priorities—tight windows maximizing security posture while neglecting buffer strategies—optimizes wrong variable: access failures create operational crises while extended windows create only theoretical exposure rarely manifesting as actual security events.
