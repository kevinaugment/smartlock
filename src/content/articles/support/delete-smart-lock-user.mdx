## Quick Answer

**To delete user: Open app → Users/Codes → Select user → Delete/Remove → Confirm → Wait 2 minutes for sync → Verify code no longer works on keypad.** Always test deleted code to confirm removal worked. For security, delete immediately after guest leaves or employee departs.

**Time required:** 2-3 minutes (delete + sync + verify)

## When to Delete Users

### Mandatory Deletion

```
Delete IMMEDIATELY when:
☑️ Guest checked out (Airbnb, VRBO)
☑️ Employee terminated or quit
☑️ Contractor finished job
☑️ Relationship ended (ex-partner, ex-roommate)
☑️ Lost phone with app access
☑️ Suspected security breach
```

### Routine Cleanup

```
Delete quarterly:
☑️ Temporary codes past expiration (if not auto-deleted)
☑️ Former service providers (old cleaner, old dog walker)
☑️ Unused codes (haven't been used in 90+ days)
☑️ Test codes (from troubleshooting)
☑️ Duplicate codes (accidentally created twice)
```

**Security rule:** If in doubt, delete it. Easy to re-add if needed.

## Step-by-Step Deletion

### Method 1: Delete via App (Most Common)

```
□ Open smart lock app
□ Select your lock (if multiple)
□ Navigate to Users / Codes / Access
□ Find user to delete
  - Scroll through list
  - OR: Search by name

□ Select user
□ Tap "Delete" or "Remove" or trash icon
□ Confirm deletion
  - App may ask "Are you sure?"
  - Confirm: Yes

□ Wait 2-5 minutes for sync
  - WiFi locks: 30-60 seconds
  - Zigbee/Z-Wave: 1-3 minutes
  - App shows "Synced" or checkmark

□ Verify deletion (CRITICAL)
  - Go to keypad
  - Try deleted code
  - Should give error beep (not unlock)
  - If still works: Wait 2 more minutes, try again
```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes total

### Method 2: Delete from Lock Keypad (Some Models)

```
Some locks allow direct deletion without app:

□ Enter programming mode
  - Usually: Master code + special button
  - Varies by brand (check manual)

□ Select delete user function
  - Navigate menu on keypad
  - Enter user slot number to delete

□ Confirm deletion
  - Keypad beeps confirmation

□ Exit programming mode

□ Test deleted code
```

**Brands supporting this:**
- Schlage  - programming code method
- Kwikset  - master code + program button
- Some Yale models

**When to use:** App not available, emergency deletion needed

### Method 3: Delete All Users (Factory Reset)

```
Nuclear option - use only if:
- Need to delete everyone at once
- Lost app access entirely
- Security breach  - delete all, start fresh

WARNING: Erases ALL codes and settings

Process varies by brand (see manufacturer manual)

After reset:
□ Set new master code immediately
□ Re-add only current/needed users
□ Update your records
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Code Still Works After Deletion

**Cause:** Sync hasn't completed or failed

**Fix:**
```
□ Wait 5 minutes total (initial + extra time)
□ Wake up lock (press any keypad button)
□ Send lock/unlock command from app (forces sync)
□ Check lock is online (must be connected to sync)
□ Try deleting again if still not synced
```

### Issue: Can't Find User to Delete

**Cause:** User in different section or mislabeled

**Fix:**
```
□ Check all sections: Users, Codes, Access, Guests
□ Look for unnamed codes (generic "User 1")
□ Sort by date added (find recent)
□ Check if in "Expired" or "Inactive" section
```

### Issue: "Cannot Delete" Error

**Cause:** Master code or admin trying to delete self

**Fix:**
```
□ Can't delete master code (by design)
□ Can't delete your own admin access (safety)
□ Have another admin delete you
□ OR: Factory reset to remove master
```

### Issue: Accidental Deletion

**Cause:** Deleted wrong user

**Fix:**
```
□ Re-add user immediately (same code if possible)
□ Check app for "Undo" option (some apps, rarely)
□ Communicate with user about new code
□ Document incident (learn from mistake)
```

## Bulk Deletion

### Delete Multiple Users at Once

**For large cleanups (Airbnb season end, office turnover):**

```
□ Make list of users to keep (short list easier)
□ Delete all others one by one
  - Some apps: Select multiple → Delete
  - Most: Delete individually

□ Verify after batch deletion
  - Test a few deleted codes
  - Spot check (don't need to test all 20)

□ Document remaining users
  - Who has access
  - What code they have
  - When added
```

**Time estimate:** 1 minute per user (including verification)

### Scheduled Deletion (Automated)

**Some systems support auto-deletion:**

```
Temporary codes:
☑️ Set expiration date/time
☑️ Code auto-deletes after expiration
☑️ No manual deletion needed

Benefits:
- Never forget to delete guest
- Reduces security risk
- Saves time

Make sure auto-delete working:
□ Check expired codes actually deleted (not just disabled)
□ Set up deletion notification
```

## Security Best Practices

### Deletion Protocol

```
When employee leaves:
□ Delete code immediately (within 1 hour)
□ Document deletion (date, time, reason)
□ Notify security/admin team
□ Change master code if they knew it
□ Review access logs for suspicious activity

When guest checks out:
□ Delete code same day (within 4 hours)
□ Verify deletion before next guest arrives
□ Clear code slot for reuse

When relationship ends:
□ Delete all access (codes + app)
□ Change master code
□ Consider physical lock change (if contentious)
```

### Audit Trail

```
Monthly review:
☑️ List all active users
☑️ Verify each should still have access
☑️ Check last used date (remove unused 90+ days)
☑️ Confirm temporary codes have expiration
☑️ Document review date
```

**Apps with audit logs:**
- August: Full access history
- Yale: Event log with user name
- Schlage: Recent activity log

## Verification Checklist

**After deleting any user:**

```
☑️ User removed from app list
☑️ Code tested and fails on keypad
☑️ User can't access via app (if they had it)
☑️ Deletion logged (if app supports)
☑️ Notification sent (if configured)
☑️ Documentation updated (who has access)
```

## Recovery if Delete Wrong User

**If you deleted wrong person:**

```
1. Don't panic - easy to fix

2. Re-add user immediately
   □ Use same code if they remember it
   □ OR: New code, communicate quickly

3. Test new code works

4. Apologize to user for confusion

5. Double-check before deleting next time
```

## Summary Checklist

**Delete smart lock user:**

1. ☑️ **Open app → Users/Codes**
2. ☑️ **Select user to delete**
3. ☑️ **Tap Delete → Confirm**
4. ☑️ **Wait 2-5 minutes** (sync time)
5. ☑️ **Test code on keypad** (should fail)
6. ☑️ **Document deletion** (who, when, why)

**When to delete:**
- ✅ Immediately: Guest checkout, employee termination
- ✅ Same day: Contractor finished, relationship ended
- ✅ Quarterly: Unused codes, expired temporary codes

**Pro tip:** Set a recurring calendar reminder for quarterly user audit. On the 1st of every 3rd month, review all smart lock users and delete any that shouldn't have access anymore. This 15-minute task prevents the gradual accumulation of security risks from forgotten old codes. Bonus: Take a screenshot of your user list after each audit as documentation!
