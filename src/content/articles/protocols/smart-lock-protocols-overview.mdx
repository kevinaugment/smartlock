## Quick Protocol Selector

**Need immediate answer?** Use our interactive tool:

🔧 **[Protocol Selection Wizard](/tools/protocol-selection-wizard)**

Or quick reference:

| Priority | Best Protocol | Battery Life |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| No hub needed | WiFi | 3-4 months |
| Maximum battery | Zigbee/Z-Wave | 12-18 months |
| Future-proof | Thread+Matter | 12-18 months |
| Large building | Z-Wave | 12-15 months |

## WiFi Protocol Overview {#wifi}

**WiFi locks connect directly to your router - no hub needed.** This simplicity comes with trade-offs: 3-4 month battery life vs 12+ months for mesh protocols.

### Architecture

```
Phone App → Cloud Server → WiFi Router → Lock
```

**Power consumption:** 60-80mW idle (always listening for WiFi)  
**Battery life:** 3-4 months on 4× AA batteries  
**Latency:** 800ms - 2.5 seconds for unlock

### When to Choose WiFi

✅ **Good for:**
- Simple setup (no hub to buy)
- 1-2 locks
- Don't mind frequent battery changes
- Rental properties

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Want maximum battery life
- Have 10+ locks
- Poor internet reliability

**Popular models:** August WiFi, Wyze Lock WiFi, Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro WiFi

## Zigbee 3.0 Protocol

**Zigbee offers 12-18 month battery life through efficient mesh networking.**

### Architecture

Requires Zigbee hub (Amazon Echo, Samsung SmartThings, etc.)

**Power:** 0.5-2mW idle (sleeps 99% of time)  
**Battery life:** 12-15 months (4× AA alkaline)  
**Range:** 30-75 feet per mesh hop

### Key Features

- Self-healing mesh network
- Zigbee 3.0 ensures cross-brand compatibility
- Requires 3+ powered routers (plugs/bulbs) for reliability

### When to Choose Zigbee

✅ **Good for:**
- Already have Zigbee hub
- Want long battery life
- Building smart home ecosystem
- Have powered Zigbee devices

❌ **Avoid if:**
- Don't want to buy hub
- Want simplest setup

**Popular models:** Yale Assure Lock 2, Schlage Encode Plus, Aqara A100

## Z-Wave Protocol {#zwave-s2}

**Z-Wave competes with Zigbee but offers superior range (100-300 feet per hop) and less interference (908 MHz vs 2.4 GHz).**

### Key Advantages

- **Better range:** 3× Zigbee distance per hop
- **Less interference:** Dedicated 908 MHz band
- **Proven reliability:** 20+ years in market
- **Strong security:** Z-Wave S2 with unique device keys

### When to Choose Z-Wave

✅ **Good for:**
- Large homes (>2500 sq ft)
- 10+ locks (multi-unit buildings)
- Thick walls (concrete/brick)
- Professional installations

**Popular models:** Schlage Encode, Yale Assure Lock 2, Kwikset SmartCode 914

## Thread + Matter: Future Standard {#matter}

**Matter is an application layer standard running on Thread (or WiFi) that enables cross-platform compatibility.**

### Key Insight

**Matter is NOT a wireless protocol** - it's a standard that works over Thread, WiFi, or Ethernet.

**For locks:** Matter typically uses Thread (low power, 12-18 month battery life)

### Game-Changer: Multi-Admin

One Matter lock simultaneously works with:
- Apple HomeKit
- Google Home  
- Amazon Alexa
- Samsung SmartThings

**No more choosing platforms at purchase!**

### Current Status (Nov 2024)

- ✅ Production-ready for basic lock/unlock + PIN management
- ✅ Major brands committed (Yale, Schlage, Aqara)
- ⚠️ Still <20 lock models available
- ⏸️ Some advanced features being standardized

### When to Choose Matter

✅ **Good for:**
- Future-proof investment
- Mixed ecosystem family
- Already have Thread Border Router
- Building new smart home

**Popular models:** Yale Assure Lock 2 Matter, Schlage Encode Plus, Aqara U100

## Protocol Comparison

| Feature | WiFi | Zigbee | Z-Wave | Matter |
|---------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Battery Life | 3-4 mo | 12-15 mo | 12-15 mo | 12-18 mo |
| Hub Required | ❌ | ✅ $40-100 | ✅ $40-100 | ✅ $99+ |
| Range/Hop | N/A | 30-75 ft | 100-300 ft | 30-75 ft |
| Interference | High | Medium | Low | Medium |
| Multi-Platform | No | No | No | ✅ Yes |
| Lock Selection | 30+ | 50+ | 40+ | <20 |

## Selection Framework

### Step 1: Count Your Locks

- **1-2 locks:** WiFi simplest  
- **3-5 locks:** Zigbee/Z-Wave  
- **6+ locks:** Mesh essential

### Step 2: Check Existing Ecosystem

- Have Zigbee hub? → Add Zigbee locks
- Have Z-Wave hub? → Add Z-Wave locks  
- No hub? → WiFi or Matter

### Step 3: Calculate TCO

💰 **[TCO Calculator](/tools/tco-calculator)** - Compare 3-year costs

**Example (1 lock, 3 years):**
- WiFi: $216 (lock + batteries)
- Zigbee: $262 (lock + hub + batteries)
- Z-Wave: $292 (lock + hub + batteries)
- Matter: $358 (lock + router + batteries)
