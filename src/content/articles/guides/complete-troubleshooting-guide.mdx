## Problem #2: Connection Issues (18% of Problems)

### Symptom: "Unable to Connect to Lock" Error

**What You See**:
- App shows "Connecting..." then "Connection Failed"
- Lock physically works  - keypad, manual key
- Previously connected successfully
- Error message: "Check network connection" or "Lock offline"

**Quick Fix Decision Tree**:

```text
START: App cannot connect to lock

Q1: Does keypad still work?
├─ YES → Lock is powered, issue is connectivity
│         Go to Q2
│
└─ NO → Lock is dead
         → Try battery replacement first

Q2: Is lock WiFi-enabled?
├─ YES (WiFi lock) → Go to WiFi troubleshooting
│         Common: August, Schlage Encode, Kwikset Halo
│
└─ NO (BLE/Z-Wave/Zigbee) → Go to Hub troubleshooting
          Common: Yale Assure (no WiFi), Schlage Connect

---WiFi Lock Troubleshooting---

Step 1: Check phone's BLE/WiFi
├─ Phone → Settings → Bluetooth: ON?
├─ Phone → Settings → WiFi: ON and connected?
└─ Phone location services: Enabled for lock app?

Step 2: Reboot phone
├─ Power off phone completely (not just lock screen)
├─ Wait 30 seconds
├─ Power on
└─ Try app again (Success rate: 40%)

Step 3: Reboot lock
├─ Remove batteries
├─ Wait 30 seconds (clears lock's memory)
├─ Reinstall batteries
├─ Wait for lock to initialize (30-60 seconds)
├─ LED should flash (indicates boot complete)
└─ Try app (Success rate: 70% cumulative)

Step 4: Check WiFi network
├─ Lock only supports 2.4GHz WiFi (NOT 5GHz)
├─ Router → Settings: Is 2.4GHz enabled?
├─ Common issue: Dual-band routers auto-select 5GHz for new devices
└─ Solution: Manually connect lock to 2.4GHz SSID

Step 5: Re-pair lock to WiFi
├─ App → Settings → WiFi Setup → Forget Network
├─ Lock → Physical reset button (hold 10 seconds)
├─ App → Add Device → Follow pairing wizard
└─ Success rate: 90% cumulative

---Hub-Based Lock Troubleshooting---

Step 1: Check hub power/status
├─ Hub LED indicator: Solid green equals good, red/off equals problem
├─ Hub power adapter: Plugged in? Outlet working?
└─ If hub offline: Power cycle hub (unplug 30 sec, plug in)

Step 2: Check hub internet connection
├─ Hub → Ethernet cable: Plugged in securely?
├─ Router → Check hub has IP address assigned
└─ Hub app: Shows "Online" status?

Step 3: Check lock-to-hub connection
├─ Distance: Lock >30 feet from hub? (Z-Wave/Zigbee max ~100 ft)
├─ Obstacles: Metal objects, water heaters, large appliances between lock & hub?
├─ Solution: Move hub closer OR add repeater
└─ Test: Temporarily move hub to same room as lock

Step 4: Re-pair lock to hub
├─ App → Devices → Lock → Remove Device
├─ Lock → Physical reset (varies by model, usually hold button 10 sec)
├─ App → Add Device → Scan for new devices
├─ Lock should appear within 60 seconds
└─ Success rate: 95% cumulative

**Still Not Working? Advanced Steps**:

1. **Check router firewall**:
   - Some routers block smart home device communication
   - Router → Settings → Firewall → Add exception for lock/hub IP
   - Or: Put lock/hub in DMZ (less secure but eliminates firewall issues)

2. **2.4GHz WiFi congestion**:
   - Download "WiFi Analyzer" app (Android) or "Airport Utility" (iOS)
   - Check channel congestion (channels 1, 6, 11 are best)
   - Router → Settings → WiFi Channel → Manually select least congested

3. **IP address conflict**:
   - Rare but possible: Two devices assigned same IP
   - Router → DHCP Settings → Reserve IP for lock/hub
   - Or: Reboot router (clears all assignments)

### Symptom: Intermittent Connection (Works Sometimes)

**What You See**:
- Lock connects successfully 50-80% of attempts
- Other times: "Connection timeout" or very slow  - 30+ seconds
- Pattern: Worse at certain times of day OR after specific events

**Root Causes**:

| Cause | Symptoms | Solution | Success Rate |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Weak signal** | Worse when farther from hub/router | Move hub closer, add repeater | 90% |
| **2.4GHz interference** | Worse 6-9pm (neighbors home using WiFi), microwave running | Change WiFi channel, use 5GHz for other devices | 70% |
| **Battery low** | Worse when battery <30% | Replace batteries | 100% |
| **Loose battery contact** | Pattern: Works after jiggling lock/door | Clean battery contacts, bend contact springs slightly | 85% |
| **Firmware bug** | Started after firmware update | Rollback firmware OR wait for fix | 60% |

## Problem #3: Mechanical Issues (22% of Problems)

### Symptom: Lock Motor Runs But Doesn't Unlock/Lock

**What You See**:
- Hear motor sound  - whirring/buzzing
- Lock attempts to turn but fails
- Error message: "Lock jammed" or "Motor stalled"
- Manual key override works fine

**Root Cause**: Mechanical misalignment (85% of cases)

**Solution - Door Alignment Check**:

Step-by-Step Alignment Fix:

1. Identify the problem
   ├─ Close door (don't lock yet)
   ├─ Manually turn deadbolt (use thumb turn or key)
   ├─ Does it turn smoothly? 
   │   ├─ YES → Problem is electronic (not mechanical)
   │   └─ NO → Proceed to Step 2

2. Check strike plate alignment
   ├─ Open door
   ├─ Extend deadbolt fully
   ├─ Slowly close door (don't force)
   ├─ Does deadbolt slide into strike plate hole easily?
   │   ├─ YES → Strike plate OK, check door frame (Step 3)
   │   └─ NO → Strike plate misaligned (Step 4)

3. Check door sag (common in old doors)
   ├─ Stand back, look at door
   ├─ Top corner closer to frame than bottom? (door sags)
   ├─ Test: Lift door handle while locking
   │   ├─ Works when lifted? → Door hinge sag (Step 5)
   │   └─ Doesn't help? → Strike plate issue (Step 4)

4. Adjust strike plate (most common fix)
   ├─ Tools needed: Phillips screwdriver, pencil
   ├─ Close door, mark where deadbolt hits frame (pencil)
   ├─ Open door, locate strike plate
   ├─ Is pencil mark centered in strike plate hole?
   │   ├─ Mark above hole → Move strike plate UP
   │   ├─ Mark below hole → Move strike plate DOWN
   │   ├─ Mark left/right of hole → Adjust horizontally
   │
   ├─ Loosen strike plate screws (don't remove)
   ├─ Slide plate to align with mark
   ├─ Tighten screws
   ├─ Test: Does deadbolt slide in smoothly now?
   │   ├─ YES → Fixed! Tighten screws fully
   │   └─ NO → May need to file strike plate hole larger (call professional)

5. Fix door hinge sag
   ├─ Tighten all hinge screws (top, middle, bottom)
   ├─ If screws spin (stripped holes):
   │   ├─ Remove screw
   │   ├─ Insert toothpicks or matchsticks into hole
   │   ├─ Break off flush with surface
   │   ├─ Reinsert screw (will bite into wood)
   │
   ├─ If door still sags:
   │   ├─ Install longer screws in top hinge (3" instead of 1")
   │   ├─ This pulls door up slightly
   │
   ├─ Test lock again

6. Lubricate (if binding detected)
   ├─ DO NOT use WD-40 or oil (attracts dust, gums up)
   ├─ USE: Dry graphite powder or PTFE spray
   ├─ Spray into keyhole, on deadbolt
   ├─ Work lock back and forth 10 times
   ├─ Wipe excess

Success Rate by Step:
- Step 4  - Strike plate adjust: 70%
- Step 5  - Hinge tighten: 85% cumulative
- Step 6  - Lubricate: 90% cumulative
- If still failing: Call locksmith  - 10% require professional
