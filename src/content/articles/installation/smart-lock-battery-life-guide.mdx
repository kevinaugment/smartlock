## Protocol Power Consumption Deep Dive

### WiFi: The Power Hungry Protocol

**Why WiFi drains batteries fast:**

```
WiFi Lock Idle Power Breakdown:
├─ WiFi radio (always on): 60-80mW
├─ Microcontroller: 5-10mW
├─ Sensors (door, motion): 2-5mW
└─ Total idle: 67-95mW
```

**The problem:** WiFi radio must stay connected 24/7 to receive unlock commands from cloud.

**No sleep mode possible** because:
- HTTP/MQTT requires persistent connection
- Lock must poll cloud every 1-5 minutes
- Any disconnect = can't unlock remotely

**Battery capacity math:**
```
4× AA alkaline = 3000mAh each @ 1.5V = 18Wh total
WiFi lock @ 80mW idle = 225 hours = 9.4 days

Add 20 unlocks/day @ 500mW × 3 sec = 0.008Wh/day
Real-world: 3-4 months with typical usage
```

**Optimization potential:** Limited to 15-25% improvement (signal strength, polling frequency)

### Zigbee/Z-Wave: Efficient Sleep Cycles

**Why mesh protocols achieve 12+ months:**

```
Zigbee/Z-Wave Lock Power Profile:
├─ Sleep mode (99% of time): 0.5-2mW
├─ Wake up every 250ms: Check for messages
├─ Receive command: 10-15mW for 50ms
├─ Execute unlock: 500mW for 3 seconds
└─ Average idle: 1-2mW (40× less than WiFi)
```

**The key:** Lock sleeps 99% of time, wakes briefly to check messages.

**How it works:**
1. Lock sleeps (0.5mW)
2. Wakes every 250ms (15ms wake time)
3. Checks parent router for messages
4. If no message: back to sleep
5. If message: process command

**Battery capacity math:**
```
4× AA alkaline = 18Wh total
Zigbee @ 1.5mW average = 12,000 hours = 500 days

Add 20 unlocks/day @ 500mW × 3 sec = 0.008Wh/day
Real-world: 12-15 months
```

**Optimization potential:** 20-40% improvement (mesh quality, usage patterns)

### Thread/Matter: Most Efficient

**Why Thread achieves 15-18 months:**

Similar to Zigbee but with improvements:
- More efficient wake-up protocols
- Better power management in silicon
- Optimized IPv6 stack

**Average idle:** 0.5-1mW (slightly better than Zigbee)

## #1 Optimization: RF Signal Quality {#maximizing}

**For ALL protocols, RF signal strength is the dominant factor affecting battery life.**

### The RSSI-Battery Relationship

**RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator):** Measures radio signal quality in dBm.

**Critical thresholds:**

| RSSI | Signal Quality | Battery Impact | Action |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **-50 to -60 dBm** | Excellent | Baseline (0%) | Optimal |
| **-60 to -70 dBm** | Good | +10-20% drain | Acceptable |
| **-70 to -80 dBm** | Fair | +30-50% drain | ⚠️ Improve |
| **-80 to -90 dBm** | Poor | +60-100% drain | ❌ Critical |
| **Below -90 dBm** | Very Poor | +150%+ drain | 🔴 Unusable |

**Why this matters:**

**Poor signal forces lock to:**
- ☑️ Retransmit messages multiple times
- ☑️ Use maximum transmit power
- ☑️ Stay awake longer per wake cycle
- ☑️ Fail connections and retry

**Example impact:**
- RSSI -60 dBm: 14 months battery life
- RSSI -80 dBm: 7 months battery life (50% reduction)

### How to Check RSSI

**WiFi locks:**
1. Open manufacturer app
2. Settings → Lock Info → Signal Strength
3. Look for "WiFi Signal" or "RSSI"

**Zigbee/Z-Wave locks:**
1. Open hub admin interface
2. Find lock device
3. Check "Signal Strength" or "LQI" (Link Quality Indicator)

**Matter locks:**
1. Platform dependent (HomeKit, Google, etc.)
2. Usually in device settings
3. May show as "Connection Quality"

### Improving RF Signal

**Strategy 1: Move router/hub closer**
- Target: Lock within 30 feet of WiFi router
- For Zigbee/Z-Wave: Within 30 feet of powered router device
- Each wall reduces signal 3-5 dB
- Metal/concrete reduces signal 10-15 dB

**Strategy 2: Add WiFi extender (WiFi locks)**
- Place extender between router and lock
- Use same SSID (seamless roaming)
- Cost: $30-80
- Impact: Can improve RSSI by 10-20 dBm

**Strategy 3: Add mesh routers (Zigbee/Z-Wave)**
- Smart plugs act as routers (always powered)
- Place 1-2 plugs between hub and lock
- Cost: $15-30 per plug
- Impact: Locks can be 2-3 hops from hub

**Strategy 4: Optimize router placement**
- Center of home (not corner)
- Elevated position (not floor)
- Away from metal/concrete
- 3+ feet from other electronics

**Strategy 5: Change WiFi channel (WiFi/Zigbee only)**
- WiFi: Use 2.4 GHz band (not 5 GHz)
- Zigbee: Use channel 25 (least WiFi overlap)
- Scan for clearest channel
- Reduce interference
