## Enterprise vs Residential: Key Differences

### Why Commercial Deployments Are Different

| Aspect | Residential | Enterprise/Commercial |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Scale** | 1-5 locks | 10-1000+ locks |
| **Users** | 2-10 family | 50-5000+ employees |
| **Access patterns** | 24/7 access | Scheduled (9am-5pm) |
| **Compliance** | None | HIPAA, SOC2, etc. |
| **Integration** | Optional | Essential (HR, badge) |
| **Support** | Self-service | IT department |
| **Budget approval** | Individual | Committee/CFO |
| **Installation** | DIY | Professional |
| **Liability** | Personal | Corporate |

**Key insight:** Enterprise deployments prioritize **reliability, integration, and audit trails** over consumer convenience features.

## Multi-Building Deployment Strategy

### Scaling Across Multiple Locations

**Centralized vs distributed management:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Centralized** | Single dashboard, consistent policies | Single point of failure | <20 buildings |
| **Distributed** | Local resilience, faster response | Complex management | 20+ buildings |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both, failover | Higher cost | Enterprise scale |

### Network Architecture Options

**Option 1: Cloud-based (most common)**
```
Each Building:
- Local Z-Wave/WiFi network
- Internet gateway
↓
Cloud Management Platform
↓
Central IT Dashboard
```

**Option 2: On-premises**
```
Each Building:
- Local controller
- VPN to headquarters
↓
On-premises Server
↓
Central IT Dashboard
```

**Option 3: Hybrid**
```
Each Building:
- Local controller (offline capable)
- Cloud sync when online
↓
Cloud + On-premises backup
↓
Central IT Dashboard
```

## Access Management Best Practices

### User Provisioning Automation

**Integration with HR systems:**

```
New Employee Hired:
1. HR system creates employee record
2. Auto-triggers access provisioning
3. Lock system receives new user
4. Access code/card generated
5. Welcome email sent with instructions

Employee Terminated:
1. HR system deactivates employee
2. Auto-triggers access revocation
3. All credentials disabled immediately
4. Audit log entry created
5. Security team notified
```

**Manual provisioning time:** 15-30 minutes per user  
**Automated provisioning time:** <1 minute per user

**ROI:** 100-employee company saves 25-50 hours/year

### Access Policy Templates

**Basic office policy:**
- Employees: Mon-Fri 6am-8pm
- Managers: 24/7
- Contractors: Business hours, specific areas
- Cleaning: After hours (6pm-10pm)

**Healthcare policy:**
- Doctors: 24/7, most areas
- Nurses: Shift-based, patient areas
- Admin: Business hours, offices
- Contractors: Escorted only

**School policy:**
- Teachers: School hours + 1 hour
- Administrators: Extended hours
- Custodians: After hours
- Students: Dorm access (if applicable)
