## Quick Answer

**History missing because: lock offline when event occurred (50%), cloud sync delayed (30%), or app storage full (15%).** Fix by: ensuring lock online, forcing sync (lock/unlock once), clearing app cache, checking internet connection, updating app. History only recorded when lock connected - offline events lost. Some locks store locally (recover when reconnected), others don't (lost forever).

**Key limitation:** Most locks only log while online
**Time delay:** Cloud sync can take 1-5 minutes

## Understanding Lock History

### What Gets Logged

**Typical events:**
```
✓ Locked (method: app, keypad, auto, manual)
✓ Unlocked (method + user if known)
✓ Code used (which code/user)
✓ Failed attempts
✓ Battery level changes
✓ Tamper alerts
✓ Offline/online status
✓ Low battery warnings
```

### What Doesn't Get Logged

**NOT typically logged:**
```
✗ Manual thumb turn operations (some locks)
✗ Events while offline (unless local storage)
✗ Failed sync attempts
✗ Settings changes
```

## Common Causes & Fixes

### 1. Lock Was Offline (50%)

**Problem:**
```
Lock offline → Event happens → Not logged
- No connection = No cloud recording
- Event lost forever  - most locks
- Gap in history

Timeline:
- 2:00pm: Lock goes offline
- 2:30pm: Someone unlocks with code
- 3:00pm: Lock comes back online
- History: Missing 2:30pm event
```

**Fix/Prevention:**
```
□ Fix connectivity:
  - See: [Improve Stability Guide]
  - Add repeater
  - Strengthen signal

□ Check if lock stores locally:
  - Premium locks: Local storage (7-30 days)
  - Budget locks: No storage (lost when offline)
  - Check manual

□ If local storage:
  - Reconnect lock
  - May sync historical events
  - Wait 10-15 minutes
```

**Prevention:** Keep lock online

### 2. Cloud Sync Delay (30%)

**Problem:**
```
Event happens → Takes 1-5 min to appear in app
- Normal delay  - not instant
- User checks too quickly
- Thinks history missing

Typical delays:
- Local  - Bluetooth: Instant
- WiFi: 10-60 seconds
- Zigbee/Z-Wave: 30-120 seconds
- Cloud routing: Up to 5 minutes
```

**Fix:**
```
□ Wait 5 minutes:
  - Most events appear within this time
  - Don't panic immediately

□ Force sync:
  - Lock/unlock via app once
  - Triggers communication
  - May push pending events

□ Refresh app:
  - Pull down to refresh
  - Close and reopen app
  - Re-login if needed
```

### 3. App Cache Full (15%)

**Problem:**
```
App stores history locally:
- Cache fills up over time
- Old events not purged
- New events can't load

Symptoms:
- History stops at certain date
- No new events after X date
- App slow/laggy
```

**Fix:**
```
□ Clear app cache:

iOS:
1. Delete app
2. Reinstall from App Store
3. Login again
4. History reloads from cloud

Android:
1. Settings → Apps → [Lock App]
2. Storage → Clear Cache (NOT Clear Data)
3. Reopen app
4. History reloads

□ Update app:
  - Old app versions have bugs
  - Check App Store for updates
```

### 4. Account/Login Issues (3%)

**Problem:**
```
Wrong account logged in:
- Multiple family members
- Guest account vs admin
- Different permissions

History permissions:
- Admin: See all history
- User: Limited history
- Guest: No history
```

**Fix:**
```
□ Verify correct account:
  - Check email shown in settings
  - Right account for this lock?

□ Check permissions:
  - App → Settings → Account type
  - Admin vs User vs Guest

□ Re-login:
  - Logout
  - Login with correct credentials
  - History may reappear
```

### 5. History Retention Limits (2%)

**Problem:**
```
Lock only stores X days:
- Budget locks: 7-30 days
- Premium locks: 90-365 days
- Cloud storage costs money

After retention period:
- Old events deleted
- Only recent history visible
```

**Check limits:**
```
Common retention:
- August: 30 days free, unlimited with subscription
- Yale: 30 days
- Schlage: 30 days
- Kwikset: 14-30 days
- WiFi locks: Often limited

Check: App → Settings → Subscription or History
```

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Cloud-Based Locks (WiFi)

**Issues:**
- Internet down = No logging
- Cloud service outage = Gap in history
- Server maintenance = Temporary loss

**Mitigation:**
```
□ Check manufacturer status page
□ Wait for service restoration
□ Export important history regularly
```

### Hub-Based Locks (Zigbee/Z-Wave)

**Issues:**
- Hub offline = No logging
- Hub memory full = Limited storage
- Hub restarted = Lost recent events

**Fix:**
```
□ Check hub online
□ Restart hub
□ Clear hub cache (if available)
□ Update hub firmware
```

### Bluetooth Locks

**Issues:**
- Phone out of range = No logging
- Phone battery dead = No logging
- Very limited range  - 10-30 feet

**Reality:**
```
Bluetooth locks:
- Only log when phone connected
- Not designed for complete history
- Consider upgrade if history critical
```

## Verification

**Test history logging:**
```
□ Perform known event:
  1. Note exact time
  2. Unlock via app
  3. Wait 5 minutes
  4. Check app history
  5. Event should appear with timestamp

□ If appears:
  - Logging works
  - Previous gap was offline period

□ If doesn't appear:
  - Logging broken
  - Troubleshoot further
```

## Export History

**Save history before it's deleted:**
```
□ Check if app supports export:
  - Some apps: Export CSV
  - Some apps: Export PDF
  - Some apps: Screenshot only

□ Export methods:
  - App → History → Export/Share
  - Email to self
  - Save to Files/Drive

□ Export frequency:
  - Monthly recommended
  - Before retention period ends
  - For important properties (rentals, etc.)
```

## Workarounds

**If lock history unreliable:**
```
□ Use hub history:
  - SmartThings, Hubitat logs events
  - Often more reliable than lock's log

□ Add separate logger:
  - Home Assistant
  - Node-RED
  - Custom automation to database

□ Use camera:
  - Video doorbell
  - Visual record of access
  - More complete than lock history

□ Physical logbook:
  - Low-tech backup
  - Guests sign in/out
  - Airbnb, office use
```

## When History Critical

**For rentals, business:**
```
☑ Choose locks with proven logging
  - August (reliable history)
  - Yale (good logging)
  - Commercial locks (designed for it)

☑ Have backup logging:
  - Camera + lock
  - Hub logs + lock logs
  - Physical sign-in sheet

☑ Export regularly:
  - Weekly for high-traffic
  - Monthly for normal use
  - Before disputes arise

☑ Monitor gaps:
  - Check history daily
  - Note offline periods
  - Address connectivity immediately
```

## Summary Checklist

**Fix missing history:**

1. ☑️ **Wait 5 minutes** (sync delay normal)
2. ☑️ **Force sync** (lock/unlock once)
3. ☑️ **Refresh app** (pull down or restart)
4. ☑️ **Check lock online** (offline = no logging)
5. ☑️ **Clear app cache** (free storage)
6. ☑️ **Update app** (fix bugs)
7. ☑️ **Export history** (before retention expires)

**Key insight:** Lock must be online to log - offline events lost (most locks)

**Pro tip:** Don't rely solely on lock history for critical security/accountability. Locks can go offline, lose events, or have sync issues. For Airbnb, office, or other high-stakes uses, combine: 1) Smart lock logging, 2) Video doorbell recording, 3) Hub event logging, 4) Physical sign-in sheet. Redundancy ensures you never have gaps when you need to prove who accessed when!
